If you're reading this file, then you must have recently installed GnuCOBOL
on a Windows PC.  The README.txt file won't be very helpful to you, because
it is intended for developers planning to build the GnuCOBOL compiler from
source code.  Since you have installed a pre-built GnuCOBOL binary, you 
probably want to get started right away.

The most common problem getting started with GnuCOBOL is missing the 
environment variables needed by the compiler, which are normally
made available to sub-processes using the "set_env.cmd" script.  

The quickest way to verify your installation of this GnuCOBOL binary is to 
open a Windows CMD.EXE shell (or perhaps a Windows 10 Terminal shell), 
then navigate to your compiler folder, whatever you named it, possibly 
something like C:\GnuCOBOL.  This is sometimes erroneously called a "DOS
Window", but it's a more modern version of that shell.  

You should see a .bat file named "TestGC.cmd".  In Windows NT and higher, 
a ".cmd" file is essentially the same as a ".bat" file.  Type "TestGC" at 
the command line, and it will call "set_env.cmd" (to set required GnuCOBOL
environment variables and PATH).  Then it will compile and execute the 
"testfunc.cob" program twice, first as a .EXE file, and second as a .DLL
file.  This will verify the compiler is working and correctly installed. 
 
NOTE that the executable "testfunc" programs and listings are temporary
files and will be automatically deleted when the TestGC.cmd script ends.  

You must always run the "set_env.cmd" script when opening a new CMD.EXE 
window before compiling and executing GnuCOBOL programs.  The environment 
variables are only active for the duration of the CMD.EXE window, and
will be forgotten when the window is closed.  

It is possible to set up permanent GnuCOBOL environment variables, but 
very difficult to change them if you need to install a newer version of 
the compiler, or to simply change the name of the compiler folder or 
its path. Setting this permanently (especially adding the contained bin
folder to PATH) also creates the possiblity of conflicts with
other software on your system.  

You can double-click the "set_env.cmd" file in Windows Explorer to run it
and open a CMD.EXE window.  You can also click on the "set_env.cmd" file 
and "send to" the desktop.  That will create a desktop shortcut (icon) 
that will open a CMD.EXE window, run set_env.cmd, and leave the window 
open. Then you can CD (change directory) to a folder that contains your 
.cob or .cbl source files and begin compiling and testing.

There is also a supplied bat file named "gcx.cmd" for compiling COBOL 
programs.  You can also create your own customized bat/cmd files.  

If you open a new CMD.EXE window in a different folder or location,
you can always call the set_env.cmd file using its full path name.  
It must run in the folder where the GnuCOBOL compiler is installed
in order to correctly set the environment variables and path.  

I strongly recommend keeping your COBOL source and object code in 
your own folders, and NOT in the GnuCOBOL compiler folder. 

This version of GnuCOBOL includes GCSORT.EXE in the \bin folder where
cobc.exe resides.  The GCSORT manual is also included in the \docs
folder with GnuCOBOL manuals.

This GnuCOBOL package also includes two different versions of
the PDCurses runtime libraries, to allow you to try WinCON or WinGUI 
support for screen input-output by renaming the library.  The default 
PDCurses library is the WinCON version.

You can use any text editor with GnuCOBOL.  One popular choice is
open-source VSCodium which is the basis for Microsoft Visual
Studio Code.  You can find more about this free software and download 
it from:

https://vscodium.com/    OR

You can also find additional help in the GnuCOBOL forums on

Good Luck!
